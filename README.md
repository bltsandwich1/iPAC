# iPAC - Your Political Revolution

What is iPAC?
=============

iPAC AKA irony PAC is a Political Action Committee dedicated to making fun of every candidate in the money-war that is the US Federal Election system.

What does iPAC do?
==================

Outside of posting the dankest politically acute memes with some of the deepest meaning (no we're not kidding), we're out to rag on everyone.

"everyone" includes but is not limited to anyone running for president, senate, or the house. It also includes everyone that has ever done that (sorry FDR we're coming for you), and anyone else we feel can be the subject of a dank meme.

Where does my money go?
=======================

Mostly to an account in the Caymans.

But honestly it goes to 
A) covering our small server cost till 2016 elections are over.
B) running ads online that are a 50/50 split between dank memes and our ulterior motive of getting people to the voting booths next November.

YES, this means the memes are FREE!
